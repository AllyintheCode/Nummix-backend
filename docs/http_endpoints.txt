Nummix Backend HTTP Endpoint List (Excluding User Controller)
Generated: 2025-11-19

Notes:
- All endpoints (except health check) require authentication middleware `protect`.
- Payments routes file exists but is NOT mounted in `index.js`; add `app.use('/api/payments', paymentsRoute);` to enable.
- Status change operations use PATCH with a `/status` suffix.
- `{id}` denotes a path parameter.
